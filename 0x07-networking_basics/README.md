The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework for understanding the components and interactions of a computer network. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the late 1970s to standardize the way data is communicated between different computer systems.

The OSI model is often used as a reference model for teaching and understanding the various functions and protocols involved in computer networks. It defines seven layers of abstraction, each with its own distinct functions and protocols, and provides a common language for communication between networked systems.

The seven layers of the OSI model are:

Physical Layer: Deals with the physical aspects of network communication, such as cables, electrical signals, and data transmission speeds.
Data Link Layer: Deals with the format and control of data frames, error detection and correction, and flow control.
Network Layer: Deals with the routing of data packets from the source to the destination.
Transport Layer: Deals with the reliable transfer of data between systems, including error detection and correction, flow control, and multiplexing.
Session Layer: Deals with the establishment and management of network connections.
Presentation Layer: Deals with the formatting and encryption of data for transmission.
Application Layer: Deals with the interface between the user and the network, providing services such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.
The OSI model is a logical framework and is not directly implemented in networking hardware or software. However, many of the protocols used in computer networks are based on the functions defined in the OSI model, and understanding the model is important for working with computer networks.
